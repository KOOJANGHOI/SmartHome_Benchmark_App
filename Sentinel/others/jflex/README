Compiling Jflex source code into a lexer java file:

1) Read the manual to install Jflex on our system here: http://jflex.de/manual.html
2) Don't forget to compile the JavaCUP (.cup) file first if we want to connect the Jflex lexer with a JavaCUP parser
3) Compile the Jflex (.jflex) file using this command:

	jflex <filename>.jflex
4) A file, Lexer.java, will be generated and it can be compiled together with the Parser.java and sym.java from JavaCUP
